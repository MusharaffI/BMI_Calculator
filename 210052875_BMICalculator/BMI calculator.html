              Please ensure you understand that BMI is not always an accurate measurement for your health. <br>
              The purpose of BMI is to be an indicator of body fatness.<br>
              It is often reliable, however there are times when it is not accurate.<br>
              This calculation may overestimate your BMI in these circumstances:<br>
              <ul>
                <li> Body builders </li>
                <li> Athletes </li>
                <li> Pregnant women </li>
              </ul>
              This calculation may also underestimate your BMI in these circumstances:
              <ul>
                <li> The elderly </li>
                <li> People with physical disabilities </li>
              </ul>
             BMI is also not an accurate indicator for people with:
              <ul>
                <li> Extreme Obesity </li>
                <li> Eating disorders like anorexia </li>
              </ul>
              The calculation for BMI is done by inputting you weight in kilograms then dividing by your height in metres squared. <br>
